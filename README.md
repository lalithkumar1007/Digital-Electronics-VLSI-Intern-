 This program implements a simple voting machine using the 8051 microcontroller, a 16x2 LCD, and three push buttons representing candidates A, B, and C. Each button press increments the corresponding vote count and updates the display. The LCD shows the current number of votes for all three candidates in real time (e.g., "A:2 B:1 C:3"). The LCD is interfaced using Port 2 for data and P3.0–P3.2 for control signals. The system includes a delay for button debouncing to avoid multiple counts. It is a basic embedded application demonstrating input handling and real-time display using an LCD with 8051.
